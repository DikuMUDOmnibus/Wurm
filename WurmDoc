Welcome to WURM mud, A code based on ROM24.
====================================================

To start wurm mud you can run the startup file in the
area directory. This file assigns to sockets for the
mud to run. One is the telnet address, the main one
being 9000, the second is 2090 that is the link for
a webpage to show who is online. Its pretty neat..
But for the command line prompt you can set it manually
by typing  WURM TELNETPORT WEBWHOPORT

i.e.       wurm 9000 2090

this will set it up fine for you. The player files are
in the zip as well. The passwords are scrambles so dont
even bother...hehe. The should be out by next release.
There are alot of good commands coming in and new areas
being made. Should be pretty cool. Contact
