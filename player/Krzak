Backy  An elf who has already seen many battles at his young age.
He is many times over a veteran, and is now searching for
a cause worthy of his talents.  He is new to this realm, 
but seams to have no trouble finding his way around.
~
Desc A tall fair elf with a hard look in his watery blue eyes
stands before you.  His cocky stance is almost a challenge
to test him, but that might not be such a good idea.  His 
hands look like they would be very comfortable holding any
type of weapon, and his grim smile makes you think he 
handles them quite often.
