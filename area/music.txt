War Ensemble~
Propaganda death ensemble
Burial to be
Corpses rotting through the night
In blood laced misery
Scorched earth the policy
The reason for the singe
The pendulum it shaves the blade
The strafing air blood raid

infiltration push reserves
Encircle the front llines
Supreme art of strategy
Playing on the minds
Bombard till submission
Take all to their graves
Indication of triumph
The number that are dead

Sport the war, war support
The sport is war, total war
When victory's a massacre
The final swing is not a drill
It's how many people I can kill

Sport the war, war support
The sport is war, total war
When victory's a massacre
The final swing is not a drill
It's how many people I can kill

Be dead friend from abve
When darkness falls
Descend into my sights
Your fallen walls
Spearhead break through the lines
Flanked all around
Soldiers of attrition
Forward their ground
GRegime prophetic age
Old in its time
Flowing veins run on through
Deep in the Rhine
Center of the web
All battles scored
What is our war crimes
(Era forever more...war)

Propaganda war ensemble
Burial to be
Bones shining in the night
In blood laced misery
Campaign of elimination
Twisted psychology
When victory is to survive
And death is defeat

Sport the war, war support
The sport is total war
When victory's a massacre
When victory is survival
When this end is a slaughter
The final swing is not a drill
It's how many people I can kill

Skeletons of Society~
Minutes seem like days
Since fire ruled the sky
The rich became the beggars
And the fools became the wise
Memories linger in my brain
Of burning from the acid rain
A pain I never have won

Nothing here remains
No future and no past
No one could foresee
The end that came so fast
Hear the prophet make his guess
That paradise lies to the west
So join his quest for the sun

Shades of death are all I see
Fragments of what used to be

The world slowly decays
Destruction fills my eyes
Harboring the image
Of a spiraling demise
Burning winds release their fury
Simulating judge and jury
Drfiting flurries of pain

Deafening silence reigns
As twilight fills the sky
Eventual supremacy
Daylight waits to die
Darkness always calls my name
A pawn in this recurring game
Humanity going insane

Shades of death are all I see
Fragments of what used to be

Minutes seem like days
Corrosion fills the sky
Morbid dreams of anarchy
Brought judgment in disguise
Memories linger in my brain
Life with nothing more to gain
Perpetual madness remains

Shades of death are all I see
Skeletons of society
Fragments of what used to be
Skeletons of society

Corrosion of Conformity~
Buried~
I've been looking for answers to set you free,
Black are the reasons you gave to me,

Never, never look back,
Just move, move ahead,
You were lucky friend,
You could be dead,

Ignore the future or bury your head in the sand,
It's a two-bit fantasy that the man in your head demands,
You can say it with a vengance,
You'll be back from the grave,

Time waits for no one,
This has to be true,
Mine ran out a long time ago,
There's nothing,
Nothing you can do,
Never...

Now your living with a burdon,
That rests upon your mind,
You were lying to yourself,
'Cos you were afraid of what you'd find,
You can say it with a vengance,
You'll be back from the grave,
We'll be waiting for a long, long time,
Before your ever saved,

Drifting so far away,
Things seem so strange,
Thought you could escape,
Believed things would change,
Never...

Ignore the future or bury your head in the sand,
It's a two-bit fantasy that the man in your head demands,
You can say it with a vengance,
You'll be back from the grave,

Samarithan~
One day I saw a man,
dressed in rags with a staff in his hand,
begging for a penny to survive,

How poor a man can be,
I gave him hospitality,
A room a bed and lots of food to eat,

Still I hear his last few words,
"I can never return what you've done,
but heaven will remember and repay.",

Fifty years have gone since I saw him,
I was dying and I'd soon be dead,
Three angels stood in front of my bed,

The first one she said to me,
"Don't be afraid",
"I'll give you immortality",
"And grace for your soul"

The second had eyes of gold,
She gave me my wings,

The third gave all wisdom,
An angel could give,
.....to me

I joined with my destiny,
Eternally,
I knew I was born again,
An angel to be,
A vision beyond my dreams,
Called me by name,
So in devotion I spread my wings,
To heaven I came,
....to stay

Candlemass~
Dark are the Veils of Death~
Death is present the candle has burned out,
the scythe is raised he's eager to reap,
the extreme unction prepares for the last flight,
but God knows where you will rest,
Dark are the Veils of Death,

To sail the seas of eternal damnation,
to dross the desert of woe and despair,
or drink the chalice of divine ambrosia,
your life will be put to the test,
Dark are the Veils of Death, 

Enter the great adventure,
just wait and see,
Heaven or Hell will call you now,
when your spirit is free,

Where can your salvation be,
now when your spirit is free,
where can your salvation be,
now when your spirit is free,

Fading light,
disappearing light,
tells you darkness is to come,
ancient rites,
the death-mass itself,
has never revealed where you will go,

You will enter realms where angels fear to tread,
open hidden doors within your mind,
sail with Charon sail into destiny,
accept your death make it your own choice,

This Mortal Coil~

Tearing down the walls,
breaching frontiers,
unlocking the gates,
to a new world disorder,
a fresh balance of terror,
the equilibrium of hate,
all flesh entwined,
in the equality of pain,

Archaic nescience unleashed,
entrenched in a bitter legacy,
tempered in mental scars,
all flesh entwined in mortal equality,

Piece by Piece~
Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit
Is going piece by piece
 
You have no choice of life or death
My face you will not see
I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath
Dismembered destiny
 
As soon as life has left your corpse
I'll make you part of me
No emotion
Death is all I see
 
Modulistic terror
A vast sadistic feast
The only way to exit
Is going piece by piece
 
Bones and blood lie on the ground
Rotten limbs lie dead
Decapitated bodies found
On my wall, your head!
 
On your trail I close the gap
One more life that soon won't be
No emotion
Your flesh is all I need
 
I'll send you to your maker
Confront the God you seek
A flash of red upon your chest
Safety out of reach
 
You have no choice of life or death
 My face you will not see
 I'll rip your flesh 'till there's no breath
 Dismembered destiny

Modulistic terror
 A vast sadistic feast
 There's only one way out of here
 Piece by piece

The Joker~
Some people call me the space cowboy.
Yea...
Some call me the gangster of love.
Some people call me Maurice.
Cause I speak of the pompotous of love.
People talk about me baby.
Say I'm doing you wrong, doing you wrong.
Well you worry, baby, don't worry.
Cause I'm right here, right here,
Right here, right here at home.
Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner,
I'm a lover, I'm a sinner.
I play my music in the sun.
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker.
I'm midnight toker.
I get my lovin' on the run.
You're the cutest thing that I ever did see.
I really love your peaches. Wanna shake your tree.
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time.
Ohey, baby, I'll sure show you a good time.
Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner,
I'm a lover, I'm a sinner.
I play my music in the sun.
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker.
I'm midnight toker.
Sure don't want to hurt no one.
People keep talking about me, baby.
Say I'm doing you wrong.
Well you worry, don't worry,
No don't worry mama.
Cause I'm right here at home.
You're the cutest thing that I ever did see.
I really love your peaches. Wanna shake your tree.
Lovey dovey, lovey dovey, lovey dovey all the time.
Come on baby. Show me a good time.

The Crooked Cross~
Time melts away in this living inferno,
Trapped by a cause that I once understood.
Feeling a sickness building inside of me,
Who will I really have to answer to.

March on through the rivers of red.
Souls drift, they fill the air.
Forced to fight, behind,
The crooked cross.
 
Do only what is expected of me,
With no emotions my feelings suppressed.
Blind obedience carries me through it all.
Conscience a word I learned to forget.
 
March on through the rivers of red.
Flesh burns, it fills the air. [sings: Souls drift, they fill...]
Forced to fight, behind,
The crooked cross.

Time melts away in this living inferno,
Trapped by a cause that I once understood.
Blind obedience carries me through it all,
Do only what is expected of me.
 
March on through the rivers of red.
Souls drift, they fill the air.
Forced to fight, behind,
The crooked cross.

Live undead~

Cascaded darkness
Walls close in on me.
Nailed shut but my eyes still see.
Severe anguish as my body evolves.
The pain of life after death it resolves.

Emptiness in twilight's rebirth,
The faint sounds of shoveled earth.
Madness growing as your mind dissolves.
Merely secret in my dreams.

Night grows cold, twilight's near,
On the edge of madness the wounds are sheared.
Forms of hanging, flesh shredded carcass
No spared breath.
Imprisoned in a shell, ready to explode.
Dead soul,
Stone cold,
Out into the night.

Voices inside my head
Hold me under.
Voices oppress.
Like roaring thunder.
An echo bouncing inside my brain.
How much can I take of the pain,
The pain!

A war raging deep inside my head,
A split decision that will end with me dead.

You see the agony in my eyes,
Protruding aimless,
I think it's time to die.

A cannibal's desire feeds the fire
that burns in your head.

Intense pain eats away at your brain,
Thorazine pumping through your veins.

Death walks inside you,
Smell death around you,
Hell's evil spell takes a soul,
Hear the sound of the bell
Counting off death tolls.

Laughing as you eternally rot,
Searching for human flesh
And life's blood.

Live Undead.

South of Heaven~
An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time.
Unsuspecting victims no warnings, no signs.
Judgment day the second coming arrives.
Before you see the light you must die.

Forgotten children, conform a new faith,
Avidity and lust controlled by hate.
[The] Never ending search for your shattered sanity,
Souls of Damnation in their own reality.
 
Chaos rampant,
An age of distrust.
Confrontations.
Impulsive habitat.
 
Bastard sons beget your cunting daughters,
Promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers.
Engreat souls condemned for [all] eternity,
Sustained by immoral observance a domineering deity.

Chaos rampant,
An age of distrust.
Confrontations.
Impulsive sabbath.
 
On and on, south of heaven 
On and on, south of heaven 
On and on, south of heaven 
On and on, south of heaven
 
The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul.
A force that has lived all eternity.
A never ending search for a truth never told.
The loss of all hope and your dignity.

Chaos rampant,
An age of distrust.
Confrontations.
Impulsive habitat.
 
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven
On and on, south of heaven

Day of the Lords~
This is the room, the start of it all
No portraits so fine, only sheets on the wall
I've seen the nights,
filled with bloodsports in vain
And the body is obtained
Where will it end? 
Where will it end?
Where will it end?
Where will it end?
These are your friends,
from childhood for you
Who goaded you on demanded
full proof
Withdraw maiden's heart,
and do you right in
So distorted and thin, distorted and thin
Where will it end? 
Where will it end?
Where will it end?
Where will it end?
This is the house, at the edge of the road
There's nothing disturbed,
all the windows are closed
I guess you were right,
when we talked in the heat
There's no room for the weak
no room for the weak
Where will it end? 
Where will it end?
Where will it end?
Where will it end?
This is the room, the start of it all
Dreamt I fled from you,
I remember it all
Oh I've seen the nights, filled with
bloodsport in vain
And the body's obtained, the body's obtained
Where will it end? 
Where will it end?
Where will it end?
Where will it end?

Well of Souls~
I bind unto myself
today the strong name of the trinity

Crypt of despair
the old man is there
forming a circle of magic and prayers

Guarding the well
the black hole to hell
it's evil must never arise I can tell

Holy mission
forever he's sworn
to protect our world from hatred and scorn

He will not fear
though the Sabbath is near
twelve strokes for Candlemass darkness descends

Break the circle and all hell comes loose
the well of souls must stay sealed
Anciant force of light against the dark
the well of souls must stay sealed

Black wind turns out the candles
the air grows cold and threatening
Dark shadows wicked laughter
brings darkness to your heart

Behold the goat of Mendes
red burning evil eyes
Lords prayer holy water
just faith can save you now

Disharmony, satanic serenade
Black symphony, a tribute to the plague
The twisted souls awakened by the chanting
Unchained at last, rise, they will now rise

A new days dawn, holy light
Sunlight redeems
slays the dark, warm and heals, makes you
see nightmares terror is back in your dreams

Sleep well my friend 'cause
this tales now to end, don't
believe our world is as safe's we pretend

Break the circle and all hell comes loose
the well of souls must stay sealed
Ancient force of light against the dark
the well of souls must stay sealed

In the flat field~
A gut pull drag on me,
Into the chasm gaping we,
Mirrors multy reflecting this,
Between spunk stained sheet,
And odourous whim,
Calme eye-flick-shudder within,
Assist me to walk away in sin,
Where is the string that Theseus laid,
Find me out this labyrinth place.,


I do get bored, I get bored,
In the flat field.,
I get bored, I do get bored,
In the flat field,



Yin and yang lumber punch,
Go taste a tart, then eat my lunch,
And force my slender thin and lean,
In this solemn place of fill wetting dreams,
Of black matted lace of pregnant cows,
As life maps out onto my brow,
The card is lowered in index turn,
Into my filing cabinet hemispheres spurn.,



I do get bored, I get bored,
In the flat field.,
I get bored, I do get bored,
In the flat field,



Let me catch the slit of light,
For a maidens sake,
On a maiden flight,
In the flat field I do get bored,
Replace with Piccadilly whores,
In my yearn for some cerebral fix,
Transfer me to that solid plain,
Hammer me into blazen pain,
Moulding shapes no shame to waste,
Moulding shapes no shame to waste,
And drag me there with deafening haste.,

Christian Death~
Cavity~
Let's Skirt the issue of Discipline,
Let's start an illusion,
with hand and pen,
Re-read the words and start again,
Accept the gift of sin,
The gift of ...,
Pleasure is bleeding to smoother the words,
The four walls drain me dry,
of all imagination,
Crying out to be told to stand still,
Crying out to be told to stand still,
The price of red death,
is the price of true love,
The black Queen jumps through my skin,
The king of hearts is waiting,
close to home,
Someone's shooting outside,
Trigger finger itchy,
Another moving target,
Move blood on your Surplice,
More blood for the price of red death,
Nailing you to the wall,
Nailing you to the Spanish Mystic,
Nailing you to the wall,
Three shots ring out to scream,
Who wants to play Roman Soldier,
that lives inside of me,
Perennial Artist what do you see?,
What do you see?,
My secret fear of being alone,
I sit and hold hands with myself,
I sit and make love to myself
I've got blood on my hands,
I've got blood on your hands,
Blood on your hands,
Blood,

Buried Dreams~
Welcome to a world of hate,
A life of buried dreams,
Smothered, by the soils of fate,
Welcome, to a world of pain,
Bitterness your only wealth,
The sands of time kicked in your face,
Rubbed in your face,
When aspirations are squashed,
When lifes chances are lost,
When all hope is gone,
When expectations are quashed,
When self esteem is lost,
When ambition is mourned,
...All you need is hate
