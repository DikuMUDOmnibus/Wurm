-1 HOMETOWN~
Your hometown is the place where you make your home. You live there or
base all your adventures out of there. The main function of choosing a
hometown, is to provide a recall spot, your hometown will be where you
recall too. ( this happens with the command recall, potions, and scrolls )

       Calinth - The main town, best for newbies to pick this one.
      Malathar - High city of the Sylvan Elves.
         Ofcol - A small village in northern Rylelia.
    New Thalos - The largest eastern city on Rylelia.

-1 ROM~
ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,  
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Athen, the sequel to the ROM code.
It will be found at hypercube.org 6666, when it is opened.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files

ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (enchant armor, the new poofin/poofout), and many
contributions and ideas from the Merc list were used.  Portions of Rusty's
code from Moosehead also remain.

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle Taylor and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)

-1 IMMORTAL IMMORT GOD WIZARD WIZ~
'Immortal' (often, simply, 'immort') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game.  Here, anyone of level 52
or higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the
usual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;
examples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to
creation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,
ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote
players to immortality.

Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal
behavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without
explicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please
don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or
you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to
this file.

The duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,
are topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are
fraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)

Alot of the helps are being adjusted and fixed. Please read them if you
need some help before you ask an immortal.

If you really have a problem send up a pray. ( type help pray for info )

Things are very stable now, a couple of things are still being fixed but
you will not see too many more skills or changes till a larger player
base is online. 

Expect to die, things are not that easy.

-1 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING'~
Player killing and player stealing are allowed to all.

Being killed is a normal part of everyday life in Rylelia. Dont
take it too personally. You can only be killed by someone within
5 levels of you, but dont use this to mock or insult other players,
as most will NOT forget and just wait for you to come into range.

~

52 COMMANDMENTS LAWS 'GOD RULES' GODS~
.
***********************
THE RULES OF THE REALMS
***********************
 
1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.
 
2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own. 
    Unless of course you LIKE deletion. Yes this includes tanking,
    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,    
    and softening up or altering mobs.
 
3)  Do not transfer or summon mobs to mortals or mortals to mobs.
    They have legs, if they want to kill a mob, they can easilly
    go there themselves.
 
4)  DO NOT kill the shopkeepers for any reason at ALL.
 
5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.
 
6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't.
 
7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT 
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some 
    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels
    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).
 
8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you 
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.
 
9)  Do not try to overrule each other.  
 
10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal
    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.

~

-1 RULES~
These are the rules of ROM.  For other matters, use common sense.

* Limited player killing and stealing within 5 levels.

* Your presence here is a privilege not a right. Obey any orders from gods, and
  you will be fine.  Deletion does not require a reason, appeals are to be sent
  to the implementors.
 
* No multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with 
  other characters you own -- by any arrangment.
 
* Cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods
  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.

* Changes to these rules are at the discretion of the immortals, and may be
done without warning, notice, or even evidence of sanity. Walk softly,
and carry a black stick.
~

0 SUICIDE DELETE~
Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.
~

-1 RYLELIA~
Rylelia is the planet upon which you walk. A large vast place although
alot of its areas are wild and untamed. It is said to have been named
by the race Rylel, who are the oldest in existence. Rylelia is run by
the Invincible Overlord who gained his power and might through dark
magics. The principle city on Rylelia is Calinth, are large trading
port on the southwest of the main continent.
~

-1 OVERLORD~
The Invincible Overlord is the leader of the planet of Rylelia.
He is said to use dark magics and forbidden powers to keep him
ageless and in control. Although his rule is not a bad one, some
are out to destroy it. People who talk bad about the Overlord are
not usually seen again. The Militia is his primary army in times
of war, and the Cavaliers are his police force over all. No one
has seen the Overlord in hundreds of years, and only a couple of
Rylels or Sylvans even remember his face. A large castle in the
Royal district of Calinth is said to be his residence although
powerful mages tend to think he is a planeswalker, never really
setting foot in Calinth except to resolve major problems.
~

-1 GAIN~
The gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has 
been found. (Check New Thalos) The following options can be used with gain:

gain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned
gain points:  lower your creation points by 1 (costs two sessions)
gain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost
gain convert: turns 10 practices into one training session

Gain uses training sessions, not practices. (see 'help train')
Gained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or total
number of creation points. 
~

52 CLONE~
Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.  
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
~

0 SKILLS SPELLS~
The skills and spells commands are used to display your character's list
of available skills (or spells, as the case may be).  They are listed in
order of level, with mana cost (for spells) or percentage (for skills)
listed where applicable. To get a complete list type,
skills all
    or
spells all
~

0 OUTFIT~
The outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with
a new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest), 
courtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.
~

0 AUTO AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTOSPLIT~
ROM uses varies automatic actions, to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold and sacrificing corpses.  The commands are as follows:

autolist  : list all automatic actions
autoloot  : take all equipment from dead mobiles
autogold  : take all gold from dead mobiles
autosac	  : sacrifice dead monsters (if autoloot is on, only empty corpes)
autoexit  : display room exits upon entering a room
autosplit : split up spoils from combat among your group members
autoassit : makes you help group members in combat

Typing a command sets the action , typing it again removes it. 
~

-1 CLAN~
A Clan is a collection of players, united to  follow and further
a common cause.   Each clan has rules and  regulations, to find out
more about clans and their 'beliefs' type "help <clan name>".  Only
Clan  members can kill or steal from other players.  To join a Clan
you  must be level 5 or above and level 25 or below.   Speak to the
Clan Leader about joining.  If you go Loner before level 25 you may 
join a Clan later.
   Joining  a  Clan is a dangerous step.   Many adventurers live to 
kill and torture others and chances are that your paths will cross.
Remember, attacking or killing fellow clan members *IS* illegal except to 
mutiny your Clan leader.
   Existing  Clans may buy  special rooms and  mobiles by acquiring 
diamonds as payment.   To see room prices, type "help prices".  New
Clans  may be formed by  petitioning the immortals.   Please  remember that 
their word is final on all matters not covered by this help.
~

-1 PRICES PRICE~
New Clan Hall Rooms cost 50 diamonds.
Boosting the mana or healing gains for a room costs 250 diamonds.
Both in the same room costs double.
Making the Healer or Store prices lower costs 1,000 diamonds.
~

-1 COUNT~
The count command displays the number of people (that you can see) logged
into the mud.  It also displays the highest number observed that day, if
it is higher.
~

-1 GATE~
The gate spell is a powerful transportation magic that opens up a portal 
between your character and another person or creature somewhere else in the
world.  This portal will transport you and any pet you might have, but not
other members of your group.  Monsters recieve a save against gate, and
monster or players more than 3 levels higher than you can not be gated to at 
all.  God rooms, private rooms, and no recall rooms cannot be gated to, and
no recall rooms cannot be gated out of.  Finally, any god or hero is also 
immune to gate, as well as in player who has no summon set.  Clan members 
may not be gated to except by their fellow Clan members.
~

-1 AFFECTS AFFECT~
This command is used to show all the spells affecting your character. At
low levels, only the spell name will be displayed, at higher levels the
effects and duration of the spell will also be shown.  Spell effects
are no longer shown on score (this can be changed by using 'show' command).
